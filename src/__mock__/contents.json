                "I believe that people should do things they are good at or in which their hearts lie. That’s why I chose web development as my career because I believe I’m good at this and mas I am always honest, and I am never afraid of doing hard work. I have finished my graduation from the University of Computer Studies, Meiktila on Computer Science. I have taken many lessons on modern web design and development from these classes.",
                "My educational background and training keep me in this carrer. I typically work as a Backend Developer  who constanly seek out innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my three years in this industory, I've honed my critical thinkings and collaboration skills, I love working with a team. In my short time there, I've already contributed to over a dozen projects and assisted with managing one project for one of the clients.",
                "Although I'm a backend position, I really love both back-end technologies like Node.js and front-end technologies like React.js. So one thing is for sure, I'm still running. I'd like to be as a Full Stack Developer with a penchant for product development in future."
